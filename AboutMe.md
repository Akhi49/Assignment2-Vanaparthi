 ### Code Fencing

 <blockquote>

 A group of edges that connects two set of vertices in a graph is called cut in graph theory. So, at every step of Primâ€™s algorithm, we find a cut (of two sets, one contains the vertices already included in MST and other contains rest of the vertices), pick the minimum weight edge from the cut and include this vertex to MST Set.
